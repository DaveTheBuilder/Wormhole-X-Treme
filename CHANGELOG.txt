Changes 0.810:

- Broke '/wxcompass' out into its own class. Removed '/wormhole compass'.

- Broke '/wxcomplete' out into its own class. Removed '/wormhole complete'.

- Broke '/wxidc' out into its own class.

- Broke '/wxremove' out into its own class. Removed '/wormhole remove'. 
  Fixed so it toggles iris to off state before removing gates with iris 
  active.
  
- Broke '/wxlist' out into its own class. Added no permissions error message.
  Removed from '/wormhole' command.

- Added command '/wxgo' and broke it out into its own class. Added no permissions 
  error message. Removed from '/wormhole' command.

- Broke '/dial' out into its own class.

- Broke '/wxbuild' out into its own class. 

- Broke '/wormhole' out into its own class.

- Added another message for active gates. Now it will say either remote activated, or 
  activated by someone else already. 

- Added SIMPLE_PERMISSIONS config option. The default value of 'false' makes permissions
  node settings use complex mode. While the setting of true sets the plugin to check for 
  extremely simplified permissions. Permission node details can be found in the README.
  
- Refactored the WXForce class to Force. Hopefully this shuts MSSE up. ^^;

- Moved a bunch of the initial loading out of onEnable and into onLoad. 
  Now we use onEnable only for events that should only happen at plugin Enable.
  
- Updated '/wormhole' command to have more descriptive errors and built in help. 
  Updated help information for this command as well. Command now has unified messaging
  string headers. Added new 'simple' option to enabling simple permissions while the game
  is live. Requires the user to have proper permissions node for configuration in target
  mode. Removed a bunch of duplicated permissions checks. Only one check is needed at 
  beginning of command call now. 

Changes 0.801 (3/15/11 @ 22:33 PST):

- Update to the way data is pushed to signs in gate destruction and creation.
  Causes signs to update visually more reliably.
  
- Removed NPE during removal of sign gate if current sign gate's target doesn't
  have a gate target. 
  
- Initial addition of '/wxforce <gate|drop>' command, used to globally close all 
  gates and/or drop all irises temporarily (until they are dialed again). 
  Uses the 'wormhole.config' or 'wormhole.remove.all' permission nodes.
  
- Fixed '/wxremove' so that the permissions check doesn't fall through to the built
  in permissions check. :|
  
- Fixed permissions surrounding gate networks and WORMHOLE_USE_IS_TELEPORT

Changes 0.800 (3/9/11 @ 23:33 PST):

- Added pretty format messages! [dh/gyoza]

- Revamped the wormhole list and how it displays items. 

- Wormhole use cost of 0.0 no longer tells users that they were charged 0.0 when 
  using a gate. Also no longer bothers doing the iConomy calls with a 0.0 value.
  
- /wxbuild (/wormhole build) no longer blindly calls for permissions. This removes
  an NPE.
  
- /wxcompass (/wormhole compass) now has a permissions node. 'wormhole.use.compass'.
  Ops also can use the compass by default.

- New config value "WORMHOLE_USE_IS_TELEPORT"
    * Default is false (which doesn't change anything) (wormhole.use means a user
      can activate a gate, but others can still teleport form an active gate)
    * If set to true then users without wormhole.use will be unable to activate
      a gate OR TELEPORT from a gate.

- Fixed the gate active but no teleport bug (for real). 

- Fixed Iris to auto-open when dialing out. 
    * Dial gates iris will stay closed until actually connected.

- /wxcomplete properly checks for 'wormhole.network.build.NETNAME' permissions, 
  if permissions are enabled. 

- /dial now checks for 'wormhole.network.use.NETNAME' permissions if permissions 
    are enabled. The network 'Public' is always assumed to be just that. Public.
  
- /dial now properly kills timers associated with start gate when failing a dial.
  Instead of just the lights going out, and everything waiting for timers to finish.

- /wormhole go now has the permissions node 'wormhole.go'

- Check for WORMHOLE_USE_IS_TELEPORT in conjunction with 'wormhole.network.use.*'
  permissions node to disallow users who don't meet permissions requirements.

- Check for 'wormhole.network.use.*' permissions node on stargate activation 
  button/lever toggle.
  
- LAPIS_BLOCK is now an allowed Iris material.

- Properly tag gate sign dial signs with network gate was on at removal/break time.

- New command "/wxidc <gatename> <optional_set_idc>". The set can be "-clear" which 
  will clear the IDC. This command is available to OPs, wormhole.config, the console, 
  and the owner of the gate.


Changes 0.755 (3/4/11 @ 16:51PST):

- Added /wxbuild, /wxlist, and /wxremove commands as short form of their /wormhole 
  counterparts.
  
- Added /wxcompass and /wxcomplete.

- /wormhole complete and /wxcomplete optional arguments require key=value
  * To add IDC you do idc=<value>
  * To add a network you would do net=<value>
  * Example: /wxcomplete MyGate idc=Haha net=Awesome

- Fixed bug in database code which was pushing data to wrong fields.

- Minor rework in PlayerListener code pretaining to players entering stargates.

- No longer scream about iConomy 4.2 or 4.3 being unsupported.

- No longer scream about Permissions 2.5.x being unsupported.

- Reduced potential thread safety issue when accessing Iconomy.

- Lots of logging added at Level.FINE and Level.FINEST for stargate operations. 
  Most useful for debugging.
  
- Closed a potential file descriptor leak in configuration code.



Changes 0.754 (3/3/11 @ 00:54 PST):

- Iris activation levers are now destroyed when a stargate is removed. Also if
  anything is in the iris activation lever block location when creating an 
  ICD protected gate it will be destroyed properly before lever is placed.
  
- We now properly destroy all name signs before replacing them with new name sign.
  Was not checking before causing a NPE. 

- Fixed '/wormhole build <gateshape>' to use the proper argument for <gateshape>
  This of course means that users with 'wormhole.build' permissions can use 
  '/wormhole build <gateshape>' after building a DHD, and press the button to 
  instantly generate a StarGate in the shape specified.
  
- Levers got the same treatment as signs now. No more wacky floating levers on
  idc enabled gates. Lever creation code broken out into own method. Stargate
  regeneration command is going to use this.

Changes 0.753 (3/2/11 @ 19:27 PST):

- Fixed Gate Sign placement. Now no longer at right angles to the gatesign block.

- Updated serverListener onPluginEnabled checks for iConomy and Permissions to
  only go off if the plugin is not already bound to. No more multiple
  notifications about attaching to Permissions. Also fixed a minor casting issue
  in the Permissions plugins attach section of onPluginEnabled. No more casting 
  error.
  
- Error messages for onEnable checks for iConomy and Permissions should be a bit 
  useful now as we may have been loaded before Permissions.

Changes 0.752 (2/28/11 @ 20:57 PST):

- Initial iConomy 4.1 Support 

- Initial Permissions 2.5 Support (should just be drop in)

- Fixed Stargate destruction detection. Removed blockDamageEvent detection and
  added blockBreakEvent detection in its place.

- Removed dead/unused code.

Changes 0.751 (2/25/11 @ 07:53 PST):

- Initial support for iconomy 3.0

Changes 0.750 (2/22/11 @ 22:19 PST):

- Major refactoring and package name changes.

- Initial support for minecraft 1.3.

 
Changes 0.741 (2/21/11 @ 21:48 PST):

- Stopped using playerListener for commands. Use the new onCommand structure. 
  This puts us as fully onCommand compliant for when they decide to put nags 
  about how horrible the coders are who are using the examples previously given 
  to them by bukkit. ^^
  
- Bumped up our BLOCK_PHYSICS and BLOCK_FLOW priorities to Highest. When other 
  plugins cancel these for us really bad things happen. (NPE)
  Bumped our PLAYER_MOVE up to High. Once again, other plugins canceling these 
  events causes us to break in most interesting ways. (NPE)
  
- Stopped listening on PLAYER_QUIT. We never did anything with it anyways. 
  No need to hold the resources.
  
- getLogLevel() added to ConfigManager for getting Log Level from the config. 
  getLevel() added to Settings for pulling the Level data from the ConfigKeys.



Changes 0.740 (2/21/11 @ 05:45 PST):

- Initial revamp of config system. Now with 100% less chances of a dereference 
  based NPE. EVERYTHING is checked for a null. Hard coded defaults. Will update
  this to use the defaults used to generate default conf file next config push.
  
- Minor logic changes in block listener code.

- Fixed sign not being breakable? Again?

- Broke DeleteBlocks() out into DeleteGateBlocks(), DeletePortalBlocks(), 
  DeleteNameBlock(), and DeleteTeleportSignBlock(). Allows use of these 
  functions in other commands individually.
  
- Added DeleteNameSign() for deleting the name sign. This gets called when using
  "/wormhole remove" and when destroying the gate by hand. No more magic free 
  signs when destroying stargates. Still no cure for free signs when destroying
  just the Name sign.
  
- DeleteTeleportSign() and ResetTeleportSign() added. Delete nukes the sign 
  altogether. Reset sets the name on it back to the old name of the Stargate and
  wipes all other lines of text. No more gates accidentally named -gatename-.


Changes 0.736 (2/20/11 @ 03:20 MST)
- Added configurable WOOSH_DEPTH for custom gate shapes.
- Updated to work properly with latest bukkit onEntityDamage changes.
- Stargates should no longer linger in half living states after a server shutdown while stargates are active.
  On onDisable we close all gates properly. onEnable we check and close gates again, just in case.
- Woosh Depth changes require user to remove one stargate and re-add it to set the woosh_depth properly. Any attempt to start up a stargate
  before doing this will cause a NPE. Also recommended users update their .shape files with 'WOOSH_DEPTH=3', or something similar, before doing this 
  (or conversely, remove their GateShapes folder).
- Fixed stray permission 'wormhole.use' which was causing problems. Permission was broken into two permissions few releases back. 
  'wormhole.use.dialer' and 'wormhole.use.sign' or 'wormhole.use.*' Also made it so players without 'wormhole.use.sign' can not change
  wormhole sign destinations.

Changes 0.735 (2/19/11 @ 03:40 PST)
- Modified Standard.shape to have 7 chevrons that light up.
- Modified shape parsing code to support an [O:E:L:S] block in the gate design.
- Rewrote logger setup. Now there is a config option for LOG_LEVEL. Uses Java logging.Level log levels.
  Only directly effects the server log file. Allows for some extra debugging of gate shapes. Defaults to INFO. 
  Directly effects the minimum level of logging in Bukkit, which at current is set to 'null'. Should have no effect on
  anything else. This is only able to be set at startup time.
- Updated gate destruction mechanics so if the gate is in a lit state but not portaling when it is destroyed, it flips back to
  an off visual state and disables all times associated with the gate. The act of turning off the lighting means that if the block
  that was destroyed was a lit block, it will be replaced with the initial material.
- DHD no longer lights up thus allowing the DHD to be properly destroyed allowing for one way gates.
- General code cleanups.
- Updated gate splash effect to use whatever PORTAL_MATERIAL is set to. Beware with STATIONARY_LAVA. It is LAVA. It hurts. BAD. Like REALLY BAD.
  BURNS BURNS BURNS. You have been WARNED. 
- Consider this build a Beta? 

Changes 0.730 ( 2/16/11 @ 20:40 MST)
- Added custom gate shapes!
      After starting server there should be a new directory and file plugins/WormholeXTreme/GateShapes/Standard.shape
      You can look in that file to see how to make custom gates.
- Flipping the Iris switch on a gate that is locked but not active will no longer create a false event horizon.
- The DHD on outbound dialing non-signed gates activates and deactivates properly with lightstone block effect and proper messages again.
  No more instant re-activating, must DHD must be deactivated first (or time out) before reactivation. 
- Small code cleanups and dead code removal (or commenting)
- Added '/wormhole irismaterial' command and associated it with the 'wormhole.config' permission.
  Valid materials are: STONE, DIAMOND_BLOCK, GLASS, IRON_BLOCK, BEDROCK. This is a global command. 
- Fixed gate light deactivation in conjunction with the inactive timer and the /dial command.
- Added 'wormhole.list' permissions node. 
- New gate design Minimal
- Added initial gate shape debugging output. 
- Added optional extra paramater to remove - /wormhole remove <name> all (the all is optional)
        If 'all' is specified at the end, the remove will also remove all blocks associated with the gate (other than the DHD)

Changes 0.727 ( 2/16/11 @ 13:39 PST)
- Made gate connection logic a bit more reliable with regards to scheduling system.
  Gates Now will never open in a half working state. If one doesn't open, neither will stay open.
  If scheduling for timed gate closings fails, try again, if that fails cry in the log and don't open 
  infinite time wormhole.
- Fixed iris causing inability to use a gate due to lack of wormhole event horizon (water) which is 
  destroyed by the iris closing/open
- Unstable wormholes event horizons are contained by Titanium/Trinium iris. (No splash/woosh through iris)
- Iris material now user configurable via Settings.txt. Defaults to STONE.
- Iris now unable to be broken, even if player is able to destroy wormhole. Use the lever to remove the iris.
  This stops accidental stargate breaking.
- Stargate will now deactivate and drain if it is active when any of its blocks are destroyed. This should stop the flooding issue.
In Progress/Partially working:
- Debug logs have been added for the gate scheduling system and will be added for most major break points. 
  Logs will take configuration setting allowing user to set the level of logging from the config file.
  Currently prettyLog only understands info, warning, and critical. Any call to it for anything else 
  like using 0 or 4 or 400 will result in an info log.
- Changed permissions for wormhole use and removal:
    Note : this means that you *MUST* change permissions or it won't work!
    wormhole.use.sign - lets a user use sign gates.
    wormhole.use.dialer - lets a user use /dial gates
    wormhole.remove.own - lets a user remove a gate that they own.
    wormhole.remove.all - lets a user remove any gate
- Woosh has been added back into the plugin
    There is a new configuration value that lets you disable this if desired.    

Changes 0.726 ( 2/15/11 @ 05:40 PST) 
- Log output has been totally revamped. Now it should be easier to tell what we are doing in the logs.
- Fixed the ability to use the craftbukkit /reload command without giving an NPE.
- Removed a few potential file descriptor, memory, and database performance leaks.


Changes 0.725 ( 2/13/11 @ 9:15PM MST)
- Iris and IDC is now completed for non-sign gates!
- When completing the gate you use /wormhole complete <name> <idc> to set the iris deactivation code.
- A lever will appear below the activation button.
- Pressing the lever will toggle the Iris on and off.
- When the Iris is active people will be unable to come through the gate!
- When dialing a remote gate you can optionally type "/dial <name> <idc>" if the IDC is correct you will deactivate the remote iris.
- Gates will not light up when active.
- Using double quotes in commands now works!
	Examples:
	/wormhole complete "A Fun Gate"
	/dial "A Fun Gate"
	/wormhole remove "A Fun Gate"

Changes 0.71(2/12/11 @ 10:42PM MST)
- Fixed an error message to be more specific (when trying to dial from an activated gate).
- Fixed problems with TickNextTick exception (needed to use sync instead of async).
- This may cause more issues though until the underlying issue is fixed in bukkit.
- This should be *more* stable than what was done before, but isn't guaranteed to be 100% perfect.
  Edit: Looks like the fix has been pulled into the repo - just need the next build and we should be good!
- Hitting the activate button again after you have previously hit it, but before you dial something will now 'deactivate' the gate.
- Due to these big issues the handling of double quotes in names has been pushed off for another day or two, sorry for everyone with that issue!

Changes 0.70 (2/12/11 @ 4:10AM MST)
- Fixed multi-worlds!!!! GO AND EXPLORE THE MULTIVERSE!
- TIMEOUT_SHUTDOWN now works properly. Feel free to set this to something other than 0!!
- Gates now have owners
- First thing I am doing with owners is allowing owners to charge a percent of the iConomy cost
- After running this new version once you will see a new configuration value available.
- Settings are no longer overwritten on version upgrade 
- Logging is now done properly thanks to Alron @ github.
- There are some other small fixes I just don't remember them all right now.

Changes 0.67 (2/7/11 @ 6:57PM MST)
- Version 0.66 is dumb, so I had to fix it up.
- Fixed the saving bug.
- Fixed the "gate timed out" message from repeating. FINALLY!!!
- You really want to get this version. It is much better than 65 and 66

Changes 0.66 (2/7/11 @ 3:31PM MST)
- It just isn't a release without a bug....
- This release fixes a small bug from the last release where wormholes fail to save properly after shutting down the server.
- You DO NOT WANT TO UPGRADE TO THIS!!!!

Changes 0.65 (2/7/11 @ 12:10PM MST)
- Wormhole now supports multiple worlds! (and works for the newest bukkit builds). Requires craftbukkit version 271+
- Wormhole sign targets are now stored across restarts
  This means that if you target a gate at a gate via the sign, then destroy the sign, the gate will always target the last targetted gate (Across restarts!)
- Wormholes that are active on server restart will remain active when restarted.
- IDC(Iris Deactivation Code)s now work! (only for non-sign gates)
  When creating a gate you can type /wormhole create <name> <idc>
  To dial a gate with an IDC you type /dial <name> <idc>
  Currently if there is an IDC set it will always be active (later you will be able to disable).
- Network can now be specified for a sign gate!
  When creating a signed gate the first line is the gate name, the second is the network name.
  If nothing is put in second line gates will default to the "Public" network.
  The sign will only cycle through gates with the same network !

Changes 0.62 ( 2/5/11 @ 10:37AM MST)
- Fixed being unable to dial after newly creating a non-sign gate.

Changes 0.61 ( 2/4/11 @ 3:41PM MST)
- Stupid copy/paste on an error loading iConomy fixed.

Changes 0.60 ( 2/4/11 @ 3:02PM MST)
- Added configuration file
  Restart the server once and the file will be created, including your old settings.
  Changes to configuration require restart to go into effect (of course)
  Any changes made while the server is running will be written to the file on shutdown.
- Improved performance over previous fix for CraftBukkit.
- Fixed a few small issues
- Sign dialer should now be set and no longer have "No Other Gates" after a restart.
- Chunks should now be saved when server is shutdown 
- Download for jar file is now available at GitHub as per requested by several users.
  This is the jar file only!
- iConomy support!!!!
  Configuration file will have the values for this:
  Use cost: how much it costs to use a wormhole (cost to actually teleport, activating the gate is free. This should stop people from running into a gate someone else opened.)
  Build cost: How much it costs to build a wormhole.
  Ops Exempt: if set to true Ops will not be charged to use/build gates.
  I can add/change configurations as needed, but hopefully this is a good start.

Changes 0.59 ( 2/2/11 @ 12:07AM MST)
- Quick patch to fix the issues with the newest version of CraftBukkit (231)

Changes 0.55 ( 2/1/11 @ 1:10PM MST)
- Fixed some debug messages that shouldn't have been left in.
- Added /wormhole compass (Make compass point to nearest wormhole)
  Typing again will recalculate nearest wormhole.
In Progess:
- iConomy will be the next release, I just needed to remove those debug messages.

Changes 0.51 ( 1/31/11 @ 11:22AM MST)
- Fixed the spamming of timeout message.
- Added config "/wormhole activate_timeout" to change the default timeout after activating a wormhole before it dials.
- Changed config name of timeout "/wormhole timeout" to "/wormhole shutdown_timeout"
  So now there is the activation timeout (activate_timeout) and the timeout after dialing when the gate needs to shutdown (/wormhole shutdown_timeout).
  Default value for shutdown_timeout is now 0 to reduce the instances of people falling through the earth.
- Added an OP only command (to go along with listing, you probably want to be able to see where the gate actually is)
  /wormhole go <NAME>
  This will instantly teleport you to the gate so know where it is.
  This was actually in 0.39 but I have been including the source in the JAR now and you can see my source at GitHub
  Feel free to comment and suggest changes in code if you want to.
  Feel free to also make changes on your own and send them to me via GitHub - I will integrate the changes if I like them!

Changes 0.50 ( 1/30/11)
- Minecarts now can go through wormholes.
  If a player is in the cart they will go through the gate but will not be in the cart when they arrive at the other side
  I would not recommend riding carts through the gate yet until I can figure out how to keep the player in the cart on the other side. Sometimes riding a cart through the gate results in weird behavior.
- Activated but not dialed gates now timeout after 60 seconds
- Fixed a bug with portal material of WATER (it can only be STATIONARY_WATER)
  It will automatically update any WATER to STATIONARY_WATER.
  I only added the STATIONARY_LAVA as a material on a whim - but when I found out people actually wanted to use it I tried to stop the damage but was unable.
  For now STATIONARY_LAVA is probably not your best option if you want to actually use the wormholes.
- Added command /wormhole list for Ops only. Lists all stargates on your server.
- Fixed a bug with portals being created out of thin air when you hit a button.
- Portals are now required to have AIR blocks for all blocks inside the gate when constructing.
- Possibly fixed issues with linux and DB
  changed the sql connection string to ./plugins/WormholeXTremeDB from plugins/WormholeXTremeDB
- I can't seem to find any issues with the newest craftbukkit (187)
Open issues:
- DHDs can't be repaired after removing a button/dialing sign on a sign-dialing gate (workaround is to /wormhole remove and then add the button/sign, and then it will function correctly.)

Changes 0.39 ( 1/27/11)
Added support for the Permissions plugin.
Without the plugin it defaults to the previous permission settings.
Changing the built in permissions will not change the Permissions plugin at all.
Permission nodes are as follows:
wormhole.use - Able to use wormholes
wormhole.build - Able to build new wormholes
wormhole.remove - Able to remove wormholes
wormhole.config - Able to configure settings like material and timeout. (By default Ops will be able to do this as well)
Fixed the weird names on the signs issue.
Part of fixing the falling through the world is pre-loading chunks
You will need bukkit v157 or newer!
Fixed a bug stopping the PORTAL material from working (Thanks Dinnerbone)
/wormhole timeout 0 should help STOP falling through the world.
I have tried to fix the point where you teleport when making a new gate. Hopefully this fixes it it.
Existing gates SHOULD start to work again unless you are really unlucky. If a gate just refuses to put you in the right place, a /wormhole remove <name> and then just add it again and it should be fine!

Changes 0.32 (1/26/11)
Again fixing small issue stopping gates from being built.

Changes 0.31 (1/26/11)
Forgot to change one last reference to /stargate (as all commands are now /wormhole)

Changes 0.3 (1/26/11):
Name change to "WORMHOLE EXTREME"!!!
To successfully use this rename and already had "Stargates" you will need to
Rename the "StargatesDB" and all files inside it to "WormholeXTremeDB"
Delete the old Stargates.jar
Fixed sign scrolling again.
Breaking the DHD will not remove the gate - it just makes it unable to dial out
Replacing the DHD will re-enable dialing.
Permissions are now fully working and stored
Use /wormhole perms for more detail
Configuration options are now available
/wormhole timeout (3-60) : # seconds to timeout wormhole
/wormhole material <MATERIAL> : Gets or sets your portal material (air, water, lava, etc)
Possible performance improvement using ConcurrentHashMap instead of locking and using HashMap.
Iris is still in progress
